                        The Michelin Guide was originally published by Edouard and Andre Michelin in France, 1900. It was a way to increase demand for cars in France, which back then had
                        less than 3000 cars in the the entire country, and subsequently, the demand for car tyres, which the brothers manufactured. The first edition was free and included 
                        not just recommendation for restaurants, but information for motorist, such as maps, hotels and petrol stations across
                        the entirety of France. Soon, the brothers begin to publish guides for the rest of Europe, including Algeria, Tunisia, the Alps and the Rhine, Germany, Spain, Portugal
                         and the British Isles. The first english guide begin circulation in 1909 and was an

                        adaptation of the original Michelin Guide to France. After World War 1, the brothers started categorising restaurants and adding hotel listings.
                         After witnessing the popuarity of the restaraunt section, they created a team of inspectors
                        specifically to review  restaurants anonymously. The team then begin to award stars in 1926 and initially, restaurants would either get 0 or 1 star. In 1931, they
                        created a new hierarchy system with 0, 1, 2 or 3 stars that we know today. The guide then largely confined itself to Europe before finally publishing the first
                        American guide in 2005, followed by Tokyo, Hong Kong and Macau in 2007. As of 2022, there are guides to 37 countries around the world.

                        The Bib Gourmand Award is a seperate award system created by the Michelin Team, Bib being the name of Michelin's mascot. Unlike the typical Michelin Award using 
                        the star system, Bib Gourmand focused more on restaurants that offers "Exceptionally good food at moderate prices". The prices are determined by local economic
                        standards so as to allow everyone, regardless of income, to enjoy good food. As of 2022, there are a total of 2393 restaurants with the Bib Gourmand award around
                        the world with France having 454 of this award, amounting to 1/5th of the total number of awards given.

                            1 Michelin Star are given to restaraunts that are deemed to be "A very good restaurant in its category" with "High quality cooking, worth a stop".
                            Most fine dining restaurants will fall within this category, with a total of 2316 restaurants with this award in 2022. In more recent years,
                            non-fine dining restaurants have also been awarded 1 Michelin Star, including Hawker Centers in Singapore and Street Food in Thailand, both having
                            16 and 24 restaurants with this award respectively.

                        2 Michelin Star are given to restaraunts that are deemed to have "Excellent cooking, worth a detour".
                        There are much fewer restaurants with this award compared to those with 1 Michelin Star, having only 425 restaraunts within this category
                        globally. Compared to the Bib Gourmand or 1 Michelin Star, there is a greater focus on service as well as the cuisine's quality and
                        presentation. France still has the highest number of award within this category, with 73 restaurants, however in 2nd place, Japan overtakes other

                            3 Michelin Star is the most prestigious award a restaurant can get. These restaurants are deemed to have "Exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey".
                            Only 18 countries in the world have this award, and only 125 restaurants in the world have attained this award. Unsurpringsly, France has the most

                        As we can see from the word cloud, despite only having Michelin guides for 37 countries, there is actually a wide range of cuisines offered by restaurants that have won an award.
                        The most common cuisine shared between all these restaurants is the "Modern" theme, with a total of 1676 restaurants offering this type of cuisine.

                        Unfortunately, the Michelin guide is not without controversy when it comes to how it awards its stars... There have been allegations that the guide is heavily
                        biased towards Modern French cuisines as seen from the disproportionate amount of awards given to French restaurants. Additionally, there have also been
                        allegations of leniency towards Japanese cuisines as the tyre-selling company was trying to expand into Japan between 2007 and 2010.

                    <p class="award_col">
                        Michelin awards have typically been given to only fine dining restaurants with a price to match, with the highest maximum price to dine at one of these restaurants
                        being $870 USD. Many restaurants also offers set prices for a full course, as seen from the points on the scatter plot with equal minimum and maximum dining prices.
                        These courses can also go for large amount, the most expensive being $600 USD. Generally, we see that the more prestigious restaurants usually have higher price ranges,
                        while the Bib Gourmand award are at more affordable prices.
