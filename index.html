                        The <span class="bold_red">Michelin Guide</span> was originally published by Edouard and Andre Michelin in <span class="bold_red">France</span>, <span class="bold">1900</span>
                         It was a way to <span class="bold">increase demand</span> for cars in <span class="bold_red">France</span>, which back then had
                        less than <span class="bold">3000 cars</span> in the the entire country, and subsequently, the demand for car tyres, which the brothers manufactured.
                         The <span class="bold_red">first edition</span> was free and included 
                        not just recommendation for <span class="bold">restaurants</span>, but information for motorist, such as <span class="bold">maps, hotels and petrol stations</span> across
                        the entirety of <span class="bold_red">France</span>. Soon, the brothers begin to publish guides for the <span class="bold_red">rest of Europe</span>, including <span class="bold">Algeria, Tunisia,
                        the Alps and the Rhine, Germany, Spain, Portugal
                         and the British Isles</span>. The first <span class="bold_red">english guide</span> begin circulation in <span class="bold">1909</span> and was an

                        adaptation of the original <span class="bold_red">Michelin Guide</span> to <span class="bold_red">France</span>. After <span class="bold">World War 1</span>, the brothers started 
                        categorising restaurants and adding hotel listings.
                         After witnessing the popuarity of the restaraunt section, they created a team of inspectors
                        specifically to review  restaurants anonymously. The team then begin to award stars in <span class="bold">1926</span> and initially, restaurants would either
                         get <span class="bold_red">0 or 1 star</span>. In <span class="bold">1931</span>, they
                        created a new hierarchy system with <span class="bold_red">0, 1, 2 or 3 stars</span> that we know today. The guide then largely confined itself to Europe
                         before finally publishing the first
                         <span class="bold_red">American guide</span> in <span class="bold">2005</span>, followed by <span class="bold_red">Tokyo</span>, <span class="bold_red">Hong Kong</span> and <span class="bold_red">Macau</span> in <span class="bold">2007</span>.
                          As of <span class="bold">2022</span>, there are guides to <span class="bold_red">37 countries</span> around the world.

                        The <span class="bold_red">Bib Gourmand Award</span> is a seperate award system created by the Michelin Team, Bib being the name of Michelin's mascot. Unlike the typical Michelin Award using 
                        the star system, <span class="bold_red">Bib Gourmand</span> focused more on restaurants that offers <span class="bold">"Exceptionally good food at moderate prices"</span>. The <span class="bold">prices</span>
                         are determined by <span class="bold">local economic
                        standards</span> so as to allow everyone, regardless of income, to enjoy good food. As of <span class="bold">2022</span>, there are a total of <span class="bold">2393 restaurants</span> with
                         the <span class="bold_red">Bib Gourmand award</span> around

                         there is actually a  <span class="bold">wide range of cuisines</span> offered by restaurants that have won an award.
                        The most common cuisine shared between all these restaurants is the <span class="bold">"Modern"</span> theme, with a total of

                        being <span class="bold">$870 USD</span>. Many restaurants also offers set prices for a full course, as seen from the points on the <span class="bold_red">scatter plot</span> with equal minimum and maximum dining prices.
                        These courses can also go for large amount, the <span class="bold">most expensive</span>
                         being <span class="bold">$600 USD</span>. Generally, we see that the more prestigious restaurants usually have higher price ranges,
                        while the <span class="bold_red">Bib Gourmand award</span> are at more affordable prices.
